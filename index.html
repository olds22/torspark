        <h2>About Torspark</h2>
        <p>Torspark is a one man software consulting company run by me, Chris Olds.
        Yep, I'm a one man shop, and I'm proud of it. I don't see any reason to
        pretend that my company is any bigger. Besides, this means that you're
        always communicating with the person who will actually be doing the work. No
        need to worry about things getting "lost in translation" when the sales guy
        passes the work off to another employee.</p>
        <h3>The Torspark Process</h3>
        <h5>30 minute free consultation</h5>
        <p>I'll start with a free 30 minute phone call to get a quick understanding
        of your business and see how I can help.
        This is where I'll ask you about your project to make sure it's a good fit
        before we proceed any further.</p>
        <h5>Trial Project</h5>
        <p>If your schedule allows, I like to start with a smaller related project
        before committing to the whole thing. This gives us both a chance to "kick
        the tires" and ensure that our work styles are compatible. I usually bill
        the Trial Project at a discount rate to account for the time it takes to
        ramp up. This also gives us a chance to build a strong foundation for our
        working relationship.</p>
        <h5>Agile + Kanban + Chaos Model of Development</h5>
        <p>I've experimented with a variety of consulting and software development
        methodologies, and I've come to favor a blend of a few diffent styles. I
        like to work closely with the client/product owner/business person (you) via
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Software Development</a>
        methods, while using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Kanban</a>
        system to manage and track our day to day progress, in which we use the
        guiding principles of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_model">Chaos Model</a>
        to prioritize our tasks.</p>
        <p>That's really just a fancy way of saying that I want to work with you
        in an iterative and adaptive way, while ensuring the important stuff that
        impacts your bottom line gets done first.</p>
        <h5>Full Project</h5>
        <p>After the Trial Project is complete, We should have a good feel for how
        well we can work together on a larger scale. With this knowledge in hand,
        it'll be easy to talk some numbers and figure out a solid plan of attack
        that will lead to a significant ROI.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in exploring the possibilities, shoot me an email
        (chris at torspark.com)</p>
